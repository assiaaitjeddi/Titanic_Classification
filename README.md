<h1>Titanic Survival Prediction</h1>
<p>This project focuses on building a classification system to predict whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic. We'll analyze various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more to determine which factors were most likely to lead to survival.</p>
    
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. This project aims to analyze the Titanic dataset and develop a machine learning model to predict survival based on passenger information.</p>
    
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)</li>
        <li>Gender</li>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Number of siblings/spouses aboard</li>
        <li>Number of parents/children aboard</li>
        <li>Ticket fare</li>
        <li>Port of embarkation</li>
        <li>Survival status (0 = Not survived, 1 = Survived)</li>
    </ul>
    
<h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Data exploration and visualization to understand the distribution and relationships of different features.</li>
        <li>Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.</li>
        <li>Building and training classification models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.</li>
        <li>Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</li>
        <li>Feature importance analysis to identify which factors were most likely to lead to survival.</li>
    </ul>
